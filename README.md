# Blog-Rewriter-using-open-source-AI-models
This project is part of my journey to build an automated pipeline that scrapes blog articles from external websites, rewrites them using an LLM (Large Language Model), and prepares them for republishing on my own blog. The end goal is to have a one-click system that handles everythingâ€”from fetching content to rewriting and posting it.
